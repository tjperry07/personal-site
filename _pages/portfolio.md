## BigCommerce

At BigCommerce I was tasked with doing a full revamp of the BigCommerce developer site. This included rewriting all existing documentation, creating new spec files and finding a system that would work for both writers and the company. This meant working across the company with engineering, support and our developer advocate to create the best possible experience. As of May 31, 2020 that foundation is still in place.

Some of the work that I completed included:

* Rewrite of all developer documentation
* Creating new content to get the documentation up to date
* Rewriting API spec files
* Creating missing spec files
* Create a site IA
* Figure out if the company should build a solution or go with a SaaS solution

I have included several writing samples and specification files.

        <p class="card-text">BigCommerce released a new feature that would allow developers to make reuseable “blocks.” Customers could then add text or images to the “blocks,” making the stores easily customizable. The release required a lot of documentation to work in step with each other and strong collaboration with the project manager and engineering. The documentation included an API that needed to be checked for accuracy, a tutorial, code samples, and a full overview to explain the unfamiliar terms introduced.</p>
        <p> Please note, the sample are written in markdown and have not been reformatted from the original style</p>
