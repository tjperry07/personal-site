## BigCommerce

At BigCommerce I was tasked with doing a full revamp of the BigCommerce developer site. This included rewriting all existing documentation, creating new spec files and finding a system that would work for both writers and the company. This meant working across the company with engineering, support and our developer advocate to create the best possible experience. As of May 31, 2020 that foundation is still in place.

Some of the work that I completed included:

* Rewrite of all developer documentation
* Creating new content to get the documentation up to date
* Rewriting API spec files
* Creating missing spec files
* Create a site IA
* Figure out if the company should build a solution or go with a SaaS solution

I have included several writing samples and specification files.
