## Rapid7

My job duties at Rapid7 are much different than they were at BigCommerce. While I still write documentation and help maintain API documentation, I find myself being able to help with training, processes and helping to make overarching decisions about documentation. Some of the work I am involved in includes:
* Creating metrics around the help documentation
* Advising on what an API and SDK MVP is
* What does a developer portal need to succeed
* Creating a plan to have open-source documentation for Metasploit.com
* Working with my teammates to close the content gap on tCell
* Researching and introducing new tools to make the documentation better
* Many other projects that I hope to add here soon
* Training my teammates on new processes and writing APIs
  * [https://ux-writing-r7.netlify.app/](https://ux-writing-r7.netlify.app/) This is a [course](https://github.com/tperry-r7/ux-writing-training) I created using Hugo and Netlify. It is a really quick way to learn how to document a REST API.  For a more in-depth tutorial, I suggest [https://idratherbewriting.com/documenting-rest-apis-course-overview/](https://idratherbewriting.com/documenting-rest-apis-course-overview/). 


## BigCommerce

At BigCommerce I was tasked with doing a full revamp of the BigCommerce developer site. This included rewriting all existing documentation, creating new spec files ,and finding a system that would work for both writers and the company. This meant working across the company with engineering, support ,and our developer advocate to create the best possible experience. As of May 31, 2020, that foundation is still in place.

Some of the work that I completed included:

* Rewrite of all developer documentation
* Creating new content to get the documentation up to date
* Rewriting API spec files
* Creating missing spec files
* Create site information architecture
* Figure out if the company should build a solution or go with a SaaS solution
* Writing and testing code for the documentation
* Verifying the accuracy of specification files

I have included several writing samples and specification files.

          <p class="card-text">BigCommerce released a new feature that would allow developers to make reuseable “blocks.” Customers could then add text or images to the “blocks,” making the stores easily customizable. <a data-toggle="collapse" href="#collapsewidgetwriting" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapsewidgetwriting">

            <p>
              The release required a lot of documentation to work in step with each other and strong collaboration with the project manager and engineering. The documentation included an API that needed to be checked for accuracy, a tutorial, code samples, and a full overview to explain the unfamiliar terms introduced.

                My tasks included creating a style guide, adding samples, and making sure the information was accurate. I also found many APIs that were not documented and needed to be made public. I used a Stoplight to create the files and make the maintenance much easier for my self and others who wanted to edit the files. They were not built from code, so they needed to be handwritten. I created a style guide, worked with the engineering team, and created a system, so the specification files were kept up to date. The biggest project I completed was the Catalog.yml file. It required months of work and collaboration to make sure all the information was correctly documented. I created close to 15 spec files. I have linked to a few that set the tone for the API style guide.</p>

              <p><strong>Webhooks</strong> - Webhooks used to have a lot of confusion around them, and they were not well documented. I add some information on which events are available and created a quick tutorial based on an app our Developer Advocate had written. </p>
              <p><strong>Working with Storefront APIs</strong> - I noticed a gap in the content around how the Storefront APIs. Developers needed to know what they were and how to use them. This article is one of the earliest I wrote, and it's always a treat for me to compare this to the Widgets documentation that I wrote much later. I can see how far I have come. </p>
