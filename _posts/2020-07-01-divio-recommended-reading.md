**Update**: I've learned this system was actually created by Daniele Procida. You can read a really great in depth explanation at [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/).


I'm not going to spoil the article, but [The documentation system by Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/) is worth the read. Don't want to read it? No worries, there is a video presentation as well.

It lays out different types of documentation, how they approach writing them and how to write them and write them well. Bookmark this and refer to it if you need to explain what goes into technical documentation.

This took me about 45 minutes hour to read through.
