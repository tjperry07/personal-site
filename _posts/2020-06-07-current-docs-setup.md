I've recently created a perfect writing setup that I can use for both work and personal projects. 

## Visual Studio Code

I use Visual Studio to write in Markdown and Restructured Text. VS Code has become my text editor of choice because of all the features and plugins. 

The plugins I use consistently are:

**markdownlint** - This allows you to set rules around the format of the markdown you write. It helps me keep clean and easy to read markdown files. [ https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)

**HTTP/s and relative link checker** - This plugin checks for broken markdown links and returns the results in the Output of VS Code. [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blackmist.LinkCheckMD](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=blackmist.LinkCheckMD)

**Markdown All in One** - This plugin has a lot of markdown shortcuts to help you write markdown faster. It also includes additions for math, autocomplete and table of contents.

## Vale

Vale is a prose-style linter. I use this in my terminal to check my work against a style guide. At work, we use custom rules. In my projects, I tend to use the premade Microsoft Style Guide. [https://github.com/errata-ai/vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale)

I hope this was helpful to you.
