Hello <i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i>, and welcome to my first official blog. I say official because I have written things here and there, but never in one place. So, I made a place. Here you can find me writing about documentation, overusing emojis <i class="far fa-smile"></i> and tacos. Thanks for joining me.

You might have noticed my first set of posts all have the similar dates. That is because I didnâ€™t remember when I wrote many of these items, so they have the date from uploading.
